## About me
The beginning of my craving for frontend development was the work of an SMM specialist. 
I was surprised how the Internet unites people. How platforms for finding like-minded people were created. As a couple of intusiasts, they created great projects from sketches on a piece of paper. These stories pushed me to explore the Internet more deeply.



I intend to learn how to create tools from lines of code that help people learn something new.
